# Survey
This is my project submission for an assignment where I had to create a survey form which demonstrated basic CSS and HTML skills. I completed all assigned tasks for the project which can be verified on the live site with the task checker in the top left (simply select the Survey Form project and Run Tests).

You can view the live site at the following URL: https://mjihaduddin00.github.io/Survey/

Thanks!
